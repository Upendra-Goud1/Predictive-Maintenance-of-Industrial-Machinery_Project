## 💡 Project: Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

### Problem Statement
Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery
The Challenge:
Develop a predictive maintenance model for a fleet of industrial machines to anticipate 
failures before they occur. This project will involve analyzing sensor data from machinery 
to identify patterns that precede a failure. The goal is to create a classification model that 
can predict the type of failure (e.g., tool wear, heat dissipation, power failure) based on 
real-time operational data. This will enable proactive maintenance, reducing downtime 
and operational costs.

### Solution Overview
An end-to-end machine learning solution was developed to analyze sensor data from industrial machinery and predict potential failures. The trained model was deployed on **IBM Watson Studio** to provide accurate, real-time predictions, supporting data-driven maintenance decisions.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion:** Loaded the Kaggle dataset into IBM Watson Studio for analysis.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized sensor data for model training.  
3. **Model Building:** Trained multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.  
4. **Model Evaluation:** Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
5. **Deployment:** Deployed the best-performing Random Forest model on IBM Cloud for real-time predictions.  
6. **Testing:** Validated predictions with sample machine sensor inputs.
